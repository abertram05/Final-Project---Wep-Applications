Cyber Game Web Apps Project: 
For this project I created a game that teaches basic cybersecurity concepts through four challenges. Each challenge has a timer and a mistake limit to simulate real-world cybersecurity tasks. I implemented HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Challenge 1: Guess the Password
 - You have to guess the secret password before the timer runs out
 - Password always starts with "Cyber" and ends with a random 3-digit number and an exclamation mark
 - You have 5 attempts allowed and a 5 minute time limit
 - Hints unlock after so many failed attempts
 - There is also a Caesar cipher clue

Challenge 2: Phishing Email Analyzer
 - You have to determine if the emails are phishing or are legit
 - there are 10 emails and a 1 minute time limit per email
 - only 1 mistake is allowed and a wrong answer will restart the challenge

Challenge 3: Malware File Scanner
 - You have to identify if the files are safe or malware
 - there are 15 files that are presented one by one
 - you have 10 seconds to decide if they are safe or not
 - you have 3 mistakes allowed

Challenge 4: Digital Lock Cracker
 - You have to pick the correct tile in the 4x4 grid before the timer runs out
 - there are 16 numbered tiles and you have 10 seconds per round with 10 rounds and 10 mistakes allowed
 - clicking each tile will show feedback on which number you picked
